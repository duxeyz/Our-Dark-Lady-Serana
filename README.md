This will be the Read me page going forward for Our Dark Lady Serana
The best thing you can do to understand what you're getting into is to vist the Official Nexus page https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/73589.
The most important differences between this Wabba Jack modlist and The official Nexus collection: Plugins are cleaned (using M02 Batch cleaner on all plugins), Requirements are included and configured, related content such as additional lovers lab quest mods or othe dark fantasy mods are included to enhance experience, and most importantly the mod list is not deploted to your skyrim directory. This allows you to not worry about any collection or mods you have installed. (AKA Stock Game).
This list will require Anniversary Edition to be installed. (Wabba jack will use your base directory to verify and then create patches for the plugins within M02.)
This list is Loverlab mod heavy. As such please ensure that you have an account there. It does not include all Serana Dead Sexy Mods as I found that it would exceed free tier for Mega based downloads. All SDS mods however are Master> Dependent  based, so you should have no issues updating the list to your liking including adding or removing. 
While it does not directly affect scripts, please ensure that Alternate start mods, escpecially realm of lorkhan, load before Serana Dead Sexy. 
*Mod List in draft development Will update periodically.*

Base Requirements: Skyrim Special Edition with Anniversary Add-on.  Recommended 16GB of Ram and Video card with at least 6GB of Ram. If you are low on VRAM please use VRAMr.
